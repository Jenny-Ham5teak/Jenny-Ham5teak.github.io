# Welcome to Ham5teak!

## Introduction
Ham5teak is full fledged 1.15.2 Minecraft network based in Singapore and in Australia. We have many different gamemodes on our network such as Survival, Skyblocks, Factions, Prison, Minigames, Semi Vanilla Survival and Creative with custom plugins built-in. Our network also contains custom structures such as beautiful Spawns and PvP arenas, all constructed by our builders team. Minigames and events are also frequently hosted by our friendly and dedicated Staff team.

# Gamemodes
We have 7 different gamemodes (expandable in the future) to meet each player's needs:

## Survival
![Survival](https://jenny-ham5teak.github.io/assets/images/survival.png)
The survival game experience is complete and fun: we have many systems such as jobs, AEs, mcMMO, custom worlds, and much more. We also have protections against griefing and basically that's what makes Survival a nice gamemode to start with.

* **Jobs**: that's how a lot of player get rich on Survival: by joining jobs. This system allows you to get paid for breaking, placing, killing, fishing, and crafting, and more. Class based professions, gain experience as you perform your job. Check `/jobs list` for more info.

* **Advanced Enchantments (AEs)**: a huge framework of custom enchantments that gives that spice while PvPing. You can get them from Crates or by buying them from players. They can be really expensive so we suggest to start getting involved in them when you reach the end game.

* **mcMMO**: mcMMO introduces skills and abilities into Minecraft enhancing the native mechanics while extending the gameplay in ways that feel natural and require no client mods. mcMMO offers RPG experiences, leaderboards and parties too.

* **Crates**: in `/warp crates` we have 3 types of crates: Epic, Mystic and Legendary and each of them contain different prizes. You will need keys to open them, obtainable through the shop or with the keydrops.

* **Shops**: we have 3 types of shops in game: `/token shop`, `/hs` and `/hm`:
  
  * **Token Shop**: this is the shop where you need to spend tokens to buy goods, which are more complicated to obtain but have a higher value. Here you can buy mobs eggs, claimblocks, keys and much more.
  
  * **HamShop**: this is the shop where you buy the goods that the server offers such as building blocks, vegetables, food and minerals.
  
  * **HamMarket**: this is the shop where you buy the goods that the players offer, and it is where good deals are usually made on rare items, event items, enchanted armors, AEs and much more.

## Skyblocks
